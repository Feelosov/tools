How you work with huge code? 

My hint - use a commented text like this:

#  ..####....####...##...##..##...##..######..##..##..######...####..
#  .##..##..##..##..###.###..###.###..##......###.##....##....##.....
#  .##......##..##..##.#.##..##.#.##..####....##.###....##.....####..
#  .##..##..##..##..##...##..##...##..##......##..##....##........##.
#  ..####....####...##...##..##...##..######..##..##....##.....####..
